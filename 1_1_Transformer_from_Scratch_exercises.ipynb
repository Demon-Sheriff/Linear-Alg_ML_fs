        "Here, we'll implement a transformer from scratch, using only PyTorch's tensor operations. This will give us a good understanding of how transformers work, and how to use them. We do this by going module-by-module, in an experience which should feel somewhat similar to last week's ResNet exercises. Much like with ResNets, you'll conclude by loading in pretrained weights and verifying that your model works as expected.\n",

        ">     * LayerNorm (transforming the input to have zero mean and unit variance)\n",

        ">     * Attention (the method of computing attention patterns for residual stream vectors)\n",
        ">     * MLP (the collection of linear and nonlinear transformations which operate on each residual stream vector in the same way)\n",

        "\n",

The prediction of what comes after token 50 is only a function of the first 50 tokens, *not* of token 51. We say the transformer is **autoregressive**, because it only predicts future words based on past data."

For instance, in the sentence `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`, the names in this sentence are the most important tokens for predicting that the final token will be `\"Mary\"`, and this is because of the particular context of this sentence rather than the tokens' position.\n",

        "\n",
        "Note - sometimes we use something called a **tied embedding** - this is where we use the same weights for our $W_E$ and $W_U$ matrices. In other words, to get the logit score for a particular token at some sequence position, we just take the vector in the residual stream at that sequence position and take the inner product with the corresponding token embedding vector. This is more training-efficient (because there are fewer parameters in our model), and it might seem principled at first. After all, if two words have very similar meanings, shouldn't they have similar embedding vectors because the model will treat them the same, and similar unembedding vectors because they could both be substituted for each other in most output?\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this is actually not very principled, for the following main reason: **the direct path involving the embedding and unembedding should approximate bigram frequencies**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break down this claim. **Bigram frequencies** refers to the frequencies of pairs of words in the english language (e.g. the bigram frequency of \"Barack Obama\" is much higher than the product of the individual frequencies of the words \"Barack\" and \"Obama\"). If our model had no attention heads or MLP layers, then all we have is a linear map from our one-hot encoded token `T` to a probability distribution over the token following `T`. This map is represented by the linear transformation $t \\to t^T W_E W_U$ (where $t$ is our one-hot encoded token vector). Since the output of this transformation can only be a function of the token `T` (and no earlier tokens), the best we can do is have this map approximate the true frequency of bigrams starting with `T`, which appear in the training data. Importantly, **this is not a symmetric map**. We want `T = \"Barack\"` to result in a high probability of the next token being `\"Obama\"`, but not the other way around!\n",
        "\n",
        "Even in multi-layer models, a similar principle applies. There will be more paths through the model than just the \"direct path\" $W_E W_U$, but because of the residual connections there will always exist a direct path, so there will always be some incentive for $W_E W_U$ to approximate bigram frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "That being said, smaller (<8B parameter) LLMs still often use tied embeddings to improve training and inference efficiency. It can be easier to start from tied weights and then use MLP0 to break the symmetry than to initialize encoder and decoder with no shared structure at all.\n",

        "\n",
        "If you did the material on [training loops](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#training-loop) during the first week, this should all be familiar to you. If not, you can skim that section for an overview of the key concepts. The start of the **Training loop** section is most important, and the subsections on [Modularisation](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#modularisation) and [dataclasses](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#aside-dataclasses) are also very useful. Lastly, we'll also be using Weights and Biases to train our model - you can read about how to use it [here](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.4]_Optimization#what-is-weights-and-biases). Here are (roughly) all the things you should know for the following exercises:\n",
        "                \n",
        "* The key parts of a gradient update step are:\n",
        "    * Calculating the (cross-entropy) loss between a model's output and the true labels,\n",
        "    * `loss.backward()` - calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters,\n",
        "    * `optimizer.step()` - update the model parameters using the gradients,\n",
        "    * `optimizer.zero_grad()` - zero the gradients so they don't accumulate.\n",
        "* We can nicely package up training loops into a class, which includes methods for training and validation steps among other things. This helps with writing code that can be reused in different contexts.\n",
        "* We can use dataclasses to store all the arguments relevant to training in one place, and then pass them to our trainer class. Autocompletion is one nice bonus of this!\n",
        "    * Be careful of scope here, you want to make sure you're referring to `self.args` within the trainer class, rather than the global `args`.\n",
        "* You can use Weights and Biases to track experiments and log relevant variables. The three essential functions are:\n",
        "    * `wandb.init()` - initialize a new run, takes arguments `project`, `name` and `config` (among others).\n",
        "    * `wandb.log()` - log a dictionary of variables, e.g. `{\"loss\": loss}`. Also takes a `step` argument.\n",
        "    * `wandb.finish()` - called at the end of training (no arguments)."

        "* We've given you the argument `max_steps_per_epoch`, a hacky way of making sure the training phase in each epoch doesn't go on for too long. You can terminate each training phase after this many steps. It's set to a default value that should lead to a very short run demonstrating nontrivial model performance.\n",
        "* Remember to move tokens to your device, via `tokens.to(device)` (this should be a global variable, defined at the top of your notebook).\n",
        "* You can refer back to the training loops from the [previous chapter of the course](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#training-loop) if you'd like.\n",
        "* We've also provided an instance of the `TransformerSampler` class so you can generate text from your model during training to see how it's doing. We will cover how sampling works in the next section."

        "We've given you one implementation of `beam_search` below, which calls the `generate` and `filter` methods of the `Beams` class (these correspond to the two stages in the diagram above). The `beam_search` method works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create a list `final_logprobs_and_completions` for storing the final output, as tuples of (logprob sum, string completion).\n",
        "- Perform `max_new_tokens` steps of generation (producing a new set of beams) and filtering (getting the best beams from these combinations), while also adding terminated beams to the list of best beams\n",
        "- Return these terminated beams plus the best ones we have at the end of the steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "So all you need to do is fill in the `generate` and `filter` methods. Below, you'll find some unit tests for the `generate` and `filter` methods. When you've passed these tests, you should be able to run the full `beam_search` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important note** - by default, beam search produces a lot of repeated words / phrases / sentences. This makes sense - if the model finds some completion with a much higher logit sum than most completions in its beam search space, then it will want to repeat this completion even if it doesn't make a lot of sense in context. A common solution is to ban repetition of n-grams, which you should also implement in the function below. In other words, rather than sampling tokens from each sequence by taking `logprobs.topk(k)` in your `generate` method, you should take the `k` top tokens after filtering out those that give you repeated n-grams of length `no_repeat_ngram_size`. Good values of this parameter to try are 2 or 3 (although we recommend you try without this parameter first, so you can see how much of a difference it makes!)."
